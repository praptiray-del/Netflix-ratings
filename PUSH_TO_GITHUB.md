# 📤 Push Code to GitHub

Your code is ready to push! All changes have been committed locally. You just need to authenticate and push.

## Current Status

✅ Git repository initialized  
✅ All files committed  
✅ Remote repository configured  
⏳ Ready to push to: `https://github.com/praptiray-del/Netflix-ratings`

## Option 1: Push via HTTPS (Recommended)

### Step 1: Set Remote to HTTPS
```bash
cd /Users/praptiray/netflix-imdb-app
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/praptiray-del/Netflix-ratings.git
```

### Step 2: Push with Personal Access Token

You'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Netflix IMDb App"
4. Select scope: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

### Step 3: Push
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted:
- **Username**: `praptiray-del`
- **Password**: Paste your Personal Access Token

## Option 2: Push via SSH

If you have SSH keys set up:

### Step 1: Add GitHub to Known Hosts
```bash
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### Step 2: Set Remote to SSH
```bash
cd /Users/praptiray/netflix-imdb-app
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:praptiray-del/Netflix-ratings.git
```

### Step 3: Push
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Use GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. File → Add Local Repository
3. Choose: `/Users/praptiray/netflix-imdb-app`
4. Click "Publish repository"

## Verify Push Success

After pushing, visit:
https://github.com/praptiray-del/Netflix-ratings

You should see all your files including:
- `app/` directory with all components
- `README.md`
- `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `package.json`
- And more!

## What's Already Done

✅ All code committed with message:
```
Initial commit: Netflix IMDb Finder V1 - Complete web app with search, ratings, and Render deployment support
```

✅ Files ready to push:
- Frontend (app/page.tsx)
- Backend API (app/api/search/route.ts)
- Styling (app/globals.css, Tailwind config)
- Documentation (README.md, QUICK_START.md, RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Configuration (package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.ts)
- Environment template (.env.local.example)

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your GitHub password
- Tokens must have `repo` scope

### "Permission denied"
- Check that you have write access to the repository
- Verify you're logged in as `praptiray-del`

### "Repository not found"
- Verify the repository exists: https://github.com/praptiray-del/Netflix-ratings
- Check spelling and capitalization

## Next Steps After Push

1. ✅ Push code to GitHub
2. 🚀 Deploy to Render (see RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)
3. 🎬 Share your app with the world!
