### Error Handling
- Much more reliable (fewer 500 errors)
- Better suggestions when title not found
- Clearer error messages

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used:
1. **Search**: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/multi`
2. **Details**: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/{movie|tv}/{id}`
3. **Images**: `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500{poster_path}`

### Data Mapping:
- `vote_average` → IMDb rating (same 0-10 scale)
- `external_ids.imdb_id` → Direct IMDb link
- `credits.crew` → Director info
- `credits.cast` → Actor names
- `overview` → Plot summary

### Fallback:
If TMDB somehow fails, we still try to provide suggestions before showing error.
