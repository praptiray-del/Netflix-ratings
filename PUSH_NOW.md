# 🚀 PUSH TO GITHUB NOW - Simple Instructions

Your code is ready! Just follow ONE of these methods:

## ✨ EASIEST METHOD - Run the Script

I've created a helper script for you. Just run:

```bash
cd /Users/praptiray/netflix-imdb-app
./push_to_github.sh
```

The script will prompt you for:
- **Username**: `praptiray-del`
- **Password**: Your GitHub Personal Access Token

---

## 📝 Don't have a Personal Access Token?

### Get one in 2 minutes:

1. **Visit**: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

2. **Fill in**:
   - Note: "Netflix IMDb App"
   - Expiration: 90 days (or "No expiration")
   - ✅ Check: `repo` (Full control of private repositories)

3. **Click**: "Generate token"

4. **Copy the token** - you won't see it again!

5. **Use it as your password** when pushing

---

## 🔧 ALTERNATIVE: Manual Push

If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
cd /Users/praptiray/netflix-imdb-app
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted:
- Username: `praptiray-del`
- Password: [Paste your Personal Access Token]

---

## ✅ What Happens After Push?

Once pushed successfully, you'll see:
```
✅ Success! Your code has been pushed to GitHub!

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"Authentication failed"**
→ Use Personal Access Token, not your GitHub password

**"Permission denied"**
→ Make sure token has `repo` scope enabled

**"Repository not found"**
→ Verify: https://github.com/praptiray-del/Netflix-ratings exists
